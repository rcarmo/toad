# Amp (AmpCode)

Amp is a frontier coding agent for your terminal and editor, built by Sourcegraph.

- **Multi-Model** Sonnet, GPT-5, fast models—Amp uses them all, for what each model is best at.
- **Opinionated** You're always using the good parts of Amp. If we don't use and love a feature, we kill it.
- **On the Frontier** Amp goes where the models take it. No backcompat, no legacy features.
- **Threads** You can save and share your interactions with Amp. You wouldn't code without version control, would you?

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ so `npx` can run the adapter
- Ensure the `AMP_EXECUTABLE` environment variable points at your Amp binary (or place `amp` on `PATH`)
