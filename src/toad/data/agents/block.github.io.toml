# Goose 🪿

**An open source, extensible AI agent**

Goose is an open framework for AI agents that goes beyond code suggestions to install dependencies, execute commands, edit files, and run tests.

## Key Features

- **Extensible Framework**: Plugin-based architecture for custom tools and behaviors
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with various LLM providers
- **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)**: Native ACP support for editor integration
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI, and ACP server modes

## Configuration

You can override ACP configurations using environment variables:
- `GOOSE_PROVIDER`: Set your preferred LLM provider
- `GOOSE_MODEL`: Specify the model to use
